# ProjektPMRE
A Persona Music Reverse Engineering Project to transcribe and decompose the beloved Persona music and make them .midi or other formats that can be imported into a DAW, to make DPMVs, TPMVs, or whatever musical parodies and remixes you want. 

## Current workin' songs: 

* One Determination (i've almost finish the intro) from p3m3
* Storm for a Butterfly from p3m3
* Light in Starless Sky from p3m3
* Self Redemption from p3m4
* Beauty of Destiny from p4a
* Our Moment from p5dmn

## Future considerations: 

* Pure One Heart from p3m1
* Burn My Dread -Spring of Birth ver.- from p3m1
* One single word from p3m2
* Heart wavers from p3m2
* One Hand, One Heartbeat from p3m2
* Mechanical feelings from p3m3
* Delight you could meet from p3m3
* Resuscitation from p3m3
* Sentence from p3mp
* specialist from p4 (Never More remix version)
* and more idk

## Tech Stacks: 

i don't know jack shit about music, the only thing i could use was studio one and melodyne, well, in a pretty naive way. so why the fock did i ever start this project anyway? 

btw i'm currently tryin' to use Audidion to preprocess them before throwin' them into Melodyne, hopin' to generate more useful notes and less noise

or i can just outsource this shit to the professionals, well, for a price

any help would be appreciated, i thought it's an open source project right? if possible you can modify them and make a pull request, and i'll try to combine the efforts or what.
